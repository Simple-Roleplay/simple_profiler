# Simple Profiler
Simple Profiler is a lightweight network profiler for GMod. The profiler can be used on a production server, it is lightweight and only modifies the net trace stack when activated. A must-have for finding net spammers.

## Start the profiler
Open your console (F10) and write `profiter start`. You must have the admin usergroup to use it.

## Stop the profiler
Open your console (F10) and write `profiter stop`. A window will open to show the result. You must have the admin usergroup to use it.
